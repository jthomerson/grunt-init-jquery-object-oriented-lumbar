# grunt-init-jquery-object-oriented-lumbar

This [grunt-init][] task picks up where [grunt-init-jquery][] leaves off to give you an
easy way to create a jQuery plugin that is object oriented and uses Lumbar. By using
Lumbar with the sample project structure that will be created for you by this plugin,
you will be able to easily separate your JavaScript files to keep individual classes,
etc, separate from one another, greatly aiding with unit testing and code
maintainability.

## Installation

If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory.
It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/jthomerson/grunt-init-jquery-object-oriented-lumbar.git ~/.grunt-init/jquery-oo-lumbar
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init jquery-oo-lumbar
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change
to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
